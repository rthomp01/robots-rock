# OVERVIEW:

Thanks for checking out ROBOBALL!

ROBOBALL is a simple arcade style high score game where you play as a robot against a malfunctional baseball pitching machine that sometimes pitches fireballs.

# GOAL:

Use the robot's punch ability to hit the balls back at the pitcher and score points. But be careful not to punch a fireball as that will hurt you. Try jumping over instead! Successfully hitting a ball back at the pitcher or jumping over a fireball will award the player with one point. Getting hit by a ball or a fireball will cause you to take 1 point of damage. 3 points and you're out!

# HOW TO PLAY:

A/D - MOVE LEFT/RIGHT

LEFT CLICK - PUNCH (TRY TO TIME YOUR PUNCHES SO THAT THE TIP OF YOUR PUNCH JUST HITS INCOMING BALL)

SPACE - JUMP (JUMP OVER NASTY FIREBALLS)

ESC - PAUSE/HOW TO PLAY SCREEN

Q - (WHILE PAUSED) QUIT GAME
